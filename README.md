# WPF - WordPress Foundation
WPF is a Wordpress theme based on Zurb's Foundation HTML Framework. Foundation is designed with "mobile first" in mind. Also the theme is (more) [SEMANTIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)! For more info see [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

# Version
This theme uses the latest Foundation `v4.1.6` (including some commits planned for the release of v4.1.7) and works on the latest Wordpress version `v3.5.1`. The current WPF version is `v0.2.3`.

# WPF plugins (not included anymore!)
* WPF theme comes with "WPF Quote"-plugin that will add a quote post type togather with a special random quote widget.
* At the moment this is not included. The posttype 'quote' will come back as a post format instead including a quote widget ofcourse!
